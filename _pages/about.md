# About Me

Hello, and welcome to my academic page! My name is **Sudip Dhakal**, and I am an instructor in Computer Science and Engineering at Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU). With a rich background in both industry and academia, I am passionate about integrating real-world applications with educational experiences to prepare my students for successful careers in technology.

## Academic Journey

My academic journey is marked by a profound interest in a diverse array of topics, ranging from software engineering fundamentals to the cutting-edge fields of cybersecurity and autonomous driving technologies. I have developed and taught courses in **Secure Software Development**, **Introduction to Cybersecurity**, and **Software Engineering Fundamentals**, among others. My approach to education is deeply rooted in practical application, which is reflected in my pedagogical methods that include hands-on projects, group work, and active learning strategies.

## Research Interests

In addition to teaching, I am actively involved in research with a focus on improving safety and efficiency in technology applications. My current research projects include enhancing route planning for autonomous vehicles through advanced machine learning models and exploring cybersecurity measures for blockchain technologies. I am also working on a pioneering project aimed at using Building Information Modeling (BIM) and sensor data to predict and prevent fall risks in elderly-friendly home environments.

## Personal Interests

Outside of my professional life, I enjoy contributing to community services and engaging in activities that promote technology and education. I am also a proud descendant of Nepali heritage, often enjoying and sharing my culture's cuisine, like homemade samosas and fish crackers.

Thank you for visiting my page. I look forward to connecting with you and exploring potential collaborations in research and learning.
